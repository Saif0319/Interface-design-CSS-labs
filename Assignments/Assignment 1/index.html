                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p><em>Georgia</em> has been described as <q>having a typographic personality</q> â€” even called friendly and intimate. Since the typeface is still legible at low resolutions, it creates an old-world charm with a modern appeal for online designs. Georgia is a bit more formal than some of the more common sans serif fonts. However, it's not so formal as to look old school. If you are looking for a font that is a bit more regal, but not stiff, then this is the one you definitely must look at. It is a font that offers a much more serious and professional look on web pages or content that requires running text or big headlines.</p>
